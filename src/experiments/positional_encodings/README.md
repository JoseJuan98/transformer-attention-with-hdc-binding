## Positional Encoding Visualization



Explanation of the plots generated by the `ts_pe_visualization.py` script for positional encodings (PE):

- Heatmap of the values: This gives an overall view.
  - Isolated Sinusoidal PE: there are two halves (sine part and cosine part) because of the split between cosines and sines ("Isolated"). Also,
  it's observed vertical bands for the low dimensions (slowly changing frequencies across positions) and more horizontal-like,
  rapidly changing patterns for the higher dimensions (high frequencies).
- Specific Position Vectors: These plots helps visualize what the actual vector looks like for a given time step.
  - Isolated Sinusoidal PE: there are wave patterns across the embedding dimension. Comparing lines for different positions
  shows how the encoding uniquely identifies each position.
- Specific Dimension Values: These plots highlights the core idea of sinusoidal encoding: using waves of different
frequencies. Lines for low dimensions (e.g., 0, 1) will look like slow sine/cosine waves, while lines for high dimensions
(e.g., 126, 127) will oscillate much faster as you move along the sequence positions. This confirms that different dimensions
capture positional information at different granularities.
