# Experiment Metrics

## 1. Binding Method Experiments

Binding methods evaluated:

- `additive` (default)
- `multiplicative`
- `convolutional`


Also, two kind of embeddings methods were evaluated with each binding method:

- Linear Projection
- 1D Convolution Feature Extraction


### 1.1 - $N_L=4$

A part, from the mentioned above, the metrics in the folder [version_2](binding_methods/version_2) are the experiments run with $N_L=4$
(4 encoder layers)

#### 1.2 - $N_L=1$

A part, from the mentioned above, the metrics in the folder [version_3_N_l_1](binding_methods/version_3_N_l_1) are the experiments run
with $N_L=1$ (1 encoder layer)

## 2. Positional Encoding Experiments

### 2.1 - Fractional Power Encoding and Learnable Encoding Experiments
