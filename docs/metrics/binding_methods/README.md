# Binding Method Experiments

Binding methods evaluated:

- `additive` (default)
- `multiplicative`
- `convolutional`


Also, two kind of embeddings methods were evaluated with each binding method:

- Linear Projection
- 1D Convolution Feature Extraction

## Experiments


### 1. $N_L=4$

A part, from the mentioned above, the metrics in the folder [version_2](version_2) are the experiments run with $N_L=4$
(4 encoder layers)

#### 2. $N_L=1$

A part, from the mentioned above, the metrics in the folder [version_3_N_l_1](version_3_N_l_1) are the experiments run
with $N_L=1$ (1 encoder layer)
